	<h1>Hi there, here's some more about me!</h1>

<br>

	<p>In addition to info in my page's blurb, I've: Lived in South America for about a year (and traveled to four countries there, five if you count Puerto Rico), ridden a motorcycle cross country, gotten married (Jennifer, 20+ years, so far so good!), worked as an actor in NYC (even made it into the IMDB), worked for myself, others, and a startup, ran for office as a ballot candidate (NYS 61st district assembly), helped form a local Libertarian party chapter (Staten Island), and generally have tried to make myself useful to my fellow man. I joined the <a href="https://www.fsp.org/">Free State Project</a> and moved to New Hampshire in 2014, if you are a lover of Liberty you should sign up and move here immediately.</p>

<br>

	<p>I'm passionate about Liberty, the latest and most promising project I'm working on is with Donnie Gebert. I recently had the pleasure of editing his excellent book "The Null Hypothesis of Politics: A Direct Republic" (<a href="https://www.thenullhypothesisofpolitics.com"> find out more about it here, be sure to listen to Donnie's media appearances.</a>)</p>

<br>

	<p>I'll be producing an audiobook version soon, sub to my <a href="/blog">Blog</a> and follow Donnie to hear when it's released.</p>

<br>

	<p>Thanks for visiting!</p>
