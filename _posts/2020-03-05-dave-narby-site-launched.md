At long last, I finally got a site up (thanks Github, Jeckyll, & [Johnathan McGlone!](http://jmcglone.com/)). It's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. Learn how to host it on Gihub [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/). So far,the whole process has painless (and maybe even a bit fun!).
